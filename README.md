# YaRadio <img src="static/Icon.png" width="48">

Unofficial Desktop app for [Yandex.Radio](https://radio.yandex.ru/) with keyboard shortcuts, notifications, ad blocking and themes.

At this moment this project needs a partial code rewrite (some dependencies are deprecated, they also have some non-critical vulnerabilities, version of electron is ancient).

Known problems:
- App doesn't store user session anymore.
- Ads may still appear.

### Install
*Mac OS 10.9+, Windows 7+ and Linux are supported.*

**Mac OS and Linux versions have never attempted to build. The application may look weird. Feel free to create issue/pull request.**

#### Mac OS
Build and move `YaRadio.app` to the `/Applications` directory.

```

Exec=/full/path/to/folder/YaRadio
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/full/path/to/folder/YaRadio/resources/app/static/Icon.png
```
#### Windows
